statekeeper is a responsible for managing Docker Engine's state.

It receives desired state from the agent's desired_state_queue and performs
required stop/remove and run commands to reach the desired state.

Statekeeper receives all methods and classes that have side-effects as params
for testability. (see: StatekeeperWorker.__init__)
